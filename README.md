Introduction to the Delhi Air Quality Index Analysis & Predictor Application
The Delhi Air Quality Index Predictor is a cutting-edge digital platform designed to address the critical environmental challenge of air pollution. This interactive application offers an all-encompassing solution for predicting and analyzing air quality, leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. With its user-centric interface and powerful functionalities, the application serves as a valuable tool for individuals, researchers, policymakers, and environmentalists striving to mitigate air pollution.

At its core, the application aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on user-selected dates and times. By employing supervised learning techniques and time series analysis, it ensures accurate forecasting of pollutant concentrations and AQI levels. The predictive model is powered by the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) algorithm, renowned for its reliability in analyzing time-dependent data. This functionality allows users to not only visualize historical trends but also anticipate future pollution levels, empowering informed decision-making.
